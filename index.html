				<h3>Mixels Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>Our visitors' privacy is important to us at Cartoon Network, ("we," "us," "our"), a division of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. ("Turner"). We are providing this summary of our information practices ("Privacy Policy") because we are committed to helping our visitors understand what information is collected on our websites, online services, and mobile applications ("Site" or "Sites") and how they may control this information while exploring our Sites. This Privacy Policy governs our information practices on Mixel.com and on any Sites that we operate and that link to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be subject to separate or additional privacy notices presented at the point of data collection. Although children under 13 may visit our Sites, some portions of the Sites may be directed at teens, parents or other adults and collect information only from these older visitors.</p>
				<span class="privacySection">THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Personal Information.</span> In the future, some of our online and mobile activities, such as polls, sweepstakes and promotions, may ask for an e-mail address and possibly a first name so that we may respond to visitors' requests.   Other areas of our Sites may allow visitors to contact us or tell a friend about our Site. These areas may request personal information about the visitor or other people, such as the e-mail address of the recipient. Email addresses provided to us for these purposes will be used solely to respond to the visitor's request and are deleted from our system. </p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Device and Usage Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Online Technologies.</span> We, our service providers, and third parties collect certain information automatically when visitors use our Sites, such as the type of computer or mobile operating system (e.g., Windows or Mac) and browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, mobile Internet browser) used to access our Sites, mobile carrier, domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., AT&T, Earthlink), certain identifiers such as unique device identifier, IP address, and mobile device IP address, and usage information (such as page requests, email open rates, average time spent, video or game player settings, achievements, activities and content viewed on our Sites). We, our service providers, or third parties may use cookies or similar online technologies to collect this information and enhance our visitors' online experience. For example, we place cookies on a visitor's computer browser or device when they visit our Site so we can store their preferences and analyze their use of the Site, such as how many times someone visits our Sites and various sections of those Sites. For more information about cookies and how browser settings can be changed to reject them, visitors should check their browser's Help menu or settings. Some of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") for Adobe's Flash player and similar applications in order to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. This technology may also remember settings, such as screen size or font selection. Flash cookies are not managed through a visitor's web browser, but Flash management tools can be accessed from Adobe's website. We, our service providers, and third parties also may use clear gifs (or "web beacons"), images, or scripts to collect data, such as the number of visitors to a web page or app, or to deliver a cookie or other content to a visitor's browser or device. If a visitor decides not to accept cookies and similar online technologies from our Sites, that visitor may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of our Site. By using the Sites without rejecting cookies and similar online technologies, visitors consent to our use of such technologies to collect and process information. At this time, this Site does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include "do not track" instructions.</p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Parents, Guardians, Adults and Teens.</span> On certain Sites or portions of a Site with activities directed to an older audience, we may collect additional information from some visitors such as a full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or other information related to the activity. Similarly, certain Sites or portions of a Site may permit some visitors to share content via social media accounts, to interact with a social media plugin or to log on via other third party platform accounts such as those available through Apple's Game Center or Facebook. When a visitor uses such social media platforms and plugins, some social media account information may be shared with us, such as a user name. We may offer parents and other adult visitors the opportunity to make purchases, including items such as merchandise or gifts for friends or family, online games, virtual items and currency for use within our Sites and online games, or to enable participation in certain interactive features. In such cases, we may require the parent or adult to provide a full name, billing and mailing addresses, e-mail address, telephone number, and a credit card number. We sometimes may solicit additional voluntary information regarding shoppers' personal shopping preferences. </p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Push Notifications.</span> Visitors may choose to receive push notifications from a mobile app. Visitors can manage their push notification preferences at any time by adjusting the settings for the app on their mobile device. </p>
				<span class="privacySection">HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE </span>
				<p>In addition to providing our products, programs, and services, we use visitors' information to fulfill their transactions and respond to their requests for content and information, such as enabling them to enter our sweepstakes or contests, to express their opinions on various topics, to play games and communicate with their friends, and to offer other features, products, programs, and services that we believe may be of interest. We also use the information we collect to support our internal operations, including personalizing content and experiences for visitors, authenticating visitors, improving and personalizing the design and content of our Sites, analyzing Site usage, and serving contextual advertising. We may use the information we collect to prevent potentially illegal or offensive activities or to enforce our rights or the rights of other visitors or third parties. We also may use the information for any other purposes disclosed to visitors at the time we collect their information or according to their consent.</p>
				<span class="privacySection">HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITES</span>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Service Providers.</span> We sometimes use agents, contractors, or other service providers to provide services on our behalf to our visitors, such as providing visitors with virtual currency or items they may have purchased, redeeming the currency for virtual items or products, sending merchandise that visitors have ordered, or helping us administer and fulfill prizes for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes. In these cases, we require service providers to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information. We may also use reputable third parties and service providers for activities in support of internal operations, such as to perform analytics or to serve contextual advertisements. </p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Co-Branded Sites and Promotions.</span> Some of our Sites, or portions of our Sites, may be provided with a sponsor or by one or more of our business partners who may also collect or have access to visitors' personal information. If this is the case, we will provide a notice at the point where the personal information is collected on the Site or upon download of the mobile app. </p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Corporate Affiliates.</span> We may share visitors' information with our parent company and other Turner-affiliated companies.    </p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">External Links.</span> Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites, services, content, and applications whose information practices may be different from ours. Following these links may allow the user to go to or interact with third party websites, services, content, and applications that may offer content or games, or conduct contests or sweepstakes that are separate from our Sites. We are not responsible for the practices of these third parties, and we recommend that visitors review their privacy policies. </p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">Legal Process, Law Enforcement, and Corporate Transactions.</span> We and our agents, contractors, and service providers may disclose information we maintain when required to do so by applicable US or other law, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, or other claim or inquiry. We also may disclose such information in response to a US or other law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, and to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by US or other law or legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer visitors' information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as the sale of a Site, a merger or acquisition, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
				<p><span class="privacySubSection">With Consent.</span> We may disclose visitors' information for any other purposes with appropriate consent or at their direction.</p>
				<span class="privacySection">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER </span>
				<p>We operate globally, so it may be necessary to transfer information we collect internationally. In particular, the information provided likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us, our agents or contractors. Our privacy practices are guided by data privacy laws in the United States. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in the visitor's country of residence. By using the Sites, visitors consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of their information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any other privacy notice provided at the time the information is collected. </p>
				<span class="privacySection">OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY </span>
				<p>We maintain procedures intended to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the personal information we collect. Personal information collected at the Sites will not be stored for longer than is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or at the time the information is collected or for the purposes of complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and responding to visitor requests.</p>
				<span class="privacySection">CHOICES; QUESTIONS; CONTACT US </span>
